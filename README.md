## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jaquiel Paim. I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil, based in Portugal, currently working at [@YellowIpe](https://github.com/YellowIpe)! I'm working with C#/.NET (.NET 6 and .NET 8), more specifically as a Backend Developer ( developing RESTful APIs ) and a tiny bit as a Frontend Developer ( working with React ). However, I also like to try other programming languages and technologies like Node.js, Typescript, Golang, and Python.   

I like new challenges and experiences and I also try to be in constant learning. I have been working remotely since before the pandemic and am passionate about innovation and new technologies.
