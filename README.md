My name is Jaquiel Paim. I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil, currently working in Portugal at [@Devoteam](https://github.com/Devoteam)! I'm working with C#/.NET (.NET Framework, .NET Core, .NET 5 and .NET 6), more specifically as Backend Developer ( developing RESTful APIs ) and a tiny bit as Frontend Developer ( working with React ). However, I also like to try another programming languages and technologies like Node.js, Typescript, Golang and Python among others.   

I like new challenges and experiences and I also try to be in constant learning. At the moment I have been working remotely since before the pandemic and I am passionate about innovation and new technologies.
