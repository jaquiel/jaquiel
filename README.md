My name is Jaquiel Paim. I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil, based in Portugal, currently working with C#/.NET (.NET 6 and .NET 8), more specifically as a Backend Developer ( developing RESTful APIs and microservices ), developing and optimizing scalable, high-performance APIs, ensuring efficient integration between AI models and financial applications, and applying cloud-native development, observability, and automation practices to deliver robust and secure solutions. 

I enjoy new challenges and experiences, and I also strive to be in a state of constant learning. I have been working remotely since before the pandemic and am passionate about innovation and new technologies.
